Shame CSS
     This is not a dumping ground. It is a staging area for hacks that are
     intended to be fixed and resolved so as not to sully our
     production-ready codebase. Hacks are necessary, but they are not
     permanent, nor are they acceptable long-term. You are not done when
     you've moved your selector and rules here.

     This is not intended to be an easy fix, or a simple way out. You will
     spend time writing out your shame, and you will make it known that
     you indeed had to resort to a hack with your next commit

     Rules:
       1) Your documentation should be written in block comment format so
          that your shame is publically visible in the compiled stylesheet
          (also helpful for debugging)

       2) Name yourself so we can all scorn your lack of front-end prowess
          (or talk to you about any questions we have)

       3) Name the location your code would go were it not such a horrible
          travesty to the name of stylesheet.

       4) Give the motive behind your sociopathic manipulation of CSS, what
          areas are affected, what this solves, and most importantly...

       5) How would you go about rectifying the horrible crimes you have
          committed given more time.
